Description: We present a range of simulations to aid researchers in determining appropriate sample sizes when performing critical
    thermal limits studies (e.g. CTmin/CTmin experiments). A number of wrapper functions are provided for plotting and summarising outputs
    from these simulations. These simulations are presented in Owen, C., Sutton, G., Martin, G., van Steenderen, C., and Coetzee, J. Sample size determination for critical thermal
    limits studies. 2022. Physiological Entomology. Under review. The GUI version of this package is available on the R Shiny online server at: 
    <https://clarkevansteenderen.shinyapps.io/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/> , or it is accessible via GitHub at <https://github.com/clarkevansteenderen/ThermalSampleR_Shiny/>. We would like
    to thank Grant Duffy (University of Otago, Dundedin, New Zealand) for granting us permission to use the source code for the Test of Total Equivalency function.
